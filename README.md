Building requires GBDK 2020 and Make. Make sure to edit the makefile based on your OS and the path you have GBDK in (assumed to be the home directory `~` by default). In the project's directory in the terminal, type `make` to build and `make clean` to clean. The compiled ROM can be played on an emulator or flashcart.
